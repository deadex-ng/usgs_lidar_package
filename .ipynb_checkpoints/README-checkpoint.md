# Building a python Package

In this project I am going to produce an easy to use, reliable and
well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch,
visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular, the code
will interface with [USGS 3DEP](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep) and fetch data using their API.

### Introduction
I work at an AgriTech, which has a mix of domain experts, data scientists, data engineers. As part of the data engineering team, I have been tasked to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular,the code will interface with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API. 

### Instalation
- **Install Required Python Modules**
``` 
pip install 3deppack
```

### Quickstart **in progress**
You can use 3deppack using the command line or as a python libary.
Let's see how you can use the 3deppack as a library
